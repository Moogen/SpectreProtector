# SpectreProtector
This is a game I created with 4 friends for Global Game Jam 2019. The theme of the game jam was "What home means to you". 

Premise: 
A long time ago, humanity was at war at demonkind. You were within the ranks of the demon hunters and ultimately gave your life in the final fight to banish the demons back to hell. 
Unfortunately, the gates of hell are opening again. Humanity, and more importantly, your family are completely unprepared to face them. In fact, they don't even realize they're in danger. 
Thus, you have returned to the world of the living as a ghost, ready to risk your death to protect your family.
