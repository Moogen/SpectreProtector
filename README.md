This is a game I created with 4 friends for Global Game Jam 2019. The theme of the game jam was "What home means to you". 

Premise: 

A long time ago, humanity was at war at demonkind. You were within the ranks of the demon hunters and ultimately gave your life in the final fight to banish the demons back to hell. Unfortunately, the gates of hell are opening again. Humanity, and more importantly, your family are completely unprepared to face them. In fact, they don't even realize they're in danger. Fortunately, you built a number of holy altars within your home before you died. If you succeed in activating all of them, you could seal the demons away for good. Thus, you have returned to the world of the living as a ghost, ready to risk your death to protect your family. 

This is a resource/hazard management game in which the player must protect a wandering NPC (i.e., a family member) from a number of demon AIs while simultaneously gathering items from around the map. These items must be assembled on the plinths of an altar. Once they are all assembled, the altar will activate and send the demons on the level back to hell. There are a total of 6 levels.
